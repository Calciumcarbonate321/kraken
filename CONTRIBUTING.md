So, if you came here then you must be ready to contribute. <br> 
We don't have quite a lot of contributors / collaborators. 

Most people on github get confused between a collaborator and a contributor. 
We will show you what they all mean (not for organization repositories but normal ones)
```yml
Owner:
- Write Access
- Push Access
- Pull Access
- Can lock issues
- Turn on discussions and turn off features
- Can delete repository
- Can archive repository
- Can transfer ownership
- Can view Repository Traffic and dependencies. 
- Can create and maange projects
- Can assign issues to projects
Collaborator:
- Write Access
- Push Access
- Pull Access
- Can view Repository Traffic and dependencies. 
- Can create and maange projects
- Can assign issues to projects
- Can chat on issues when an issue is locked
Contributor:
- Gets a contributor symbol
- Does not have write access
- Has just made a pull request
- Or has made issues / discussions
```
Now in this repository, there is 1 collaborator and 2 contributors (including myself).
So if you would like to **contribute, you would need contributor access.**

Steps:
1. Fork the repository
2. Commit on your fork (on your fork you have owner)
3. Make a pull request and compare my main branch with your (master / main) branch
4. I see what you've done
5. I chat / take the pull request

The second I take the pull request and merge it into my branch, you become a contributor. 
The number of forks mean nothing, since people just fork to admire a repository and do nothing in their fork.
